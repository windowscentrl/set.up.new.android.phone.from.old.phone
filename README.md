You can set up a new Android phone from scratch and start fresh if you want, but the Android setup process also allows you to copy data from your old phone. If your old phone is also an Android, you can restore your apps, settings, and other data directly from that phone or through a cloud backup. If youâ€™re coming from an iPhone, you can install an app to transfer your data from the iPhone to the new Android phone.

Most of the steps for setting up a new Android phone are the same regardless of which kind of phone you're coming from, but the process differs when it comes to transferring data and settings from your old device.

## How to Restore From an Android Phone

* Push the power button on your new Android to turn it on. The phone will boot up, and you will be greeted with a welcome screen.
 * On the welcome screen, select your language and tap Start to continue. You can then follow the on-screen prompts to install your SIM card and set up Wi-Fi.
* When the setup wizard asks if you want to copy apps and data, tap Next. It will then present you with a list of options.
 * Select a backup from an Android phone to copy data and settings from your old Android to your new one. 
* At this point, you'll have to pick up your old Android phone and turn it on if it isn't already powered up. It will also need to be connected to the same network as your new phone.
  * To start transferring data, open the Google app, and either say, "OK Google, set up my device," or type set up my device in the search box.
  * Your old phone will locate your new phone. Verify that it has found the right phone, and then select which data and setting you wish to transfer over.
* On the new phone, you'll need to sign into your Google account, confirm the lock screen method used with your old phone, and tap Restore to start the data transfer process.
* After your new phone has been set up with data from your old phone, you can follow the on-screen prompts to complete the setup process.
 * You will be presented with a list of Google services that you can enable or disable. Your phone will function whether or not you enable these, but some features won't work if they are disabled.
 * After that, you will have the opportunity to set a new screen lock method for your phone and choose whether or not to use Google Assistant's voice match feature.
* When you reach the step that asks if there's anything else and presents you with a list of options, you're done. You can select any of the optional items if you like, or tap No thanks to wrap up the setup process.

## How to back up data on your old Android phone

* Open Settings from the Quick Settings or your apps.
* Scroll down to the bottom of the page.
* Go to the System menu.
* Tap Backup.
* Make sure the toggle for Back up to Google Drive is set to On.
* Hit Back up now to sync the latest data on the phone with Google Drive.
